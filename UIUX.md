1. Consistency:
    1) The color for the whole website is consistent. It uses dark blue, light blue, light yellow and yellow for all the pages.
    2) For all the pages requires token, there will always be a top bar with two buttons: a button with BigBrain, the name of the web to go to the dashboard and the button with word logout to trigger logout API.
2. Concise: 
    1) Some buttons has signs instead of words to show the users what will happen. For example the delete, edit and start buttons on the dashboard page.
    2) Every page is concise and each page allows user to do limited operations.
3. Feedback:
    1) For most functions, if the API returns status other than 200, the frontend will either pop an alert or lead to the error page of the error status to tell the user what is the problem.
    2) The buttons all have animations when the user hovers on the button, so the user can know that this element is clickable.
    3) Sometimes, for some important actions, like the user leaves a page without saving the changes, deleting or starting a game, the system will ask for confirmation again from the user before taking actions.
    4) When the user enters the correct url, the image or video will be automatically shown on the website.
4. Multiple Access:
    1) The user can delete or start a quiz in two ways: a) on the dashboard click the delete (or start) button of the quiz or b) on the quiz detail page click the universal delete(or start) button.
    2) The user can update the mark and time for each question in two ways: a) click the '+' or '-' botton to increase or decrease the mark or time by 1 or directly enter an integer to set the mark and time.
5. Grouping: 
    For all pages, the elements are grouped carefully:
        a. in the dashboard, the delete/edit/start buttons are each grouped with a quiz, to indicate that which quiz this button will effect.
        b. in the quiz detail part, the delete/start/confirm buttons are placed on top to indicate that they are universal - to control the whole quiz. The other delete and edit buttons are each associated with a question, to indicate which question they will effect.
    There does not exist any confusing groupping that will make the users confused what he should do.
